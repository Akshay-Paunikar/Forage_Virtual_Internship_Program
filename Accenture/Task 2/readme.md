Task 2 - Data Cleaning & Modeling
You have been given a set of data sets, all containing different columns and values, as well as a data model. A data model shows the relationships between all of 
the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.
It is your job to use these data sets as well as the data model, to create your own data set that you can use to fulfill the requirements of this task.
This task is essential because it is one of the specific requirements that the client has asked for, so we are relying on the data analyst to work with 
the data and create accurate, reliable insights that can be backed up during the final presentation.
