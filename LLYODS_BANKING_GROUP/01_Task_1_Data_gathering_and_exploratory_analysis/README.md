<h2>Task 1: Data gathering and exploratory analysis</h2>

Enhance Customer retention strategies by mastering data analysis and uncovering key insights into customer behaviour

<h3>Task overview:</h3>

Welcome! In this task, you will focus on gathering and analysing data to understand customer behaviour, with the goal of uncovering key insights that will inform the development of a predictive model for customer churn.

<b>What you'll learn:</b>

 - Techniques for identifying and collecting relevant data from various sources
 - Methods for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights
 - Best practices for cleaning and preparing data for machine learning models

<b>What you'll do:</b>

<h3>Let's get started:</h3>

As you step into the role of a data science graduate at Lloyds Banking Group, you're immediately thrust into a real-world scenario with significant implications for our business. The Data Science & Analytics team, under the leadership of Li, a seasoned senior data scientist, is currently grappling with a critical project: predicting customer churn to enhance retention strategies.

Li briefs you on the situation, "We've observed a worrying trend of customers, particularly young professionals and small business owners, leaving for competitors. This project aims to reverse that trend by identifying at-risk customers and implementing targeted interventions."

Your task is crucial. You'll begin by gathering and analysing data to understand the factors contributing to customer churn to uncover actionable insights that can inform strategic decisions. The pressure is on, as SmartBank, a key subsidiary, has reported a decline in retention rates, and there's mounting pressure from senior management to deliver solutions swiftly.

Li emphasises the importance of this task, noting, "Our findings will directly impact the strategies we deploy to retain our customers. We need accurate, insightful analysis to inform these strategies."

You're not alone in this; the team is here to guide and support you. This is your opportunity to apply your skills, contributing to a project that could shape the future of customer engagement at Lloyds.

<h3>Techniques for identifying and collecting data:</h3>

<h4>Understanding the data landscape:</h4>

The first step in data collection is to understand the landscape of available data. In a corporate environment, data can come from a variety of sources, including internal databases, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, financial records, web analytics, and external data sets. Knowing where data resides and how it can be accessed is crucial for gathering relevant information efficiently.

<h4>Defining data requirements:</h4>

Clearly define what you need to know before you begin. To predict customer churn, identify key variables such as customer demographics, transaction history, customer service interactions, and usage patterns. This will help focus your efforts on collecting the most relevant and useful data for your analysis.

<h4>Data collection methods:</h4>

Data can be collected through several methods:

 - <b>Primary data collection:</b> This involves gathering data directly from the source. For example, conducting surveys and interviews, or direct observation. While primary data is specific and relevant, it can be time-consuming and costly to obtain.
 - <b>Secondary data collection:</b> Involves using existing data collected for another purpose. This could include historical data, third-party data sets, or data obtained from public sources. Secondary data is often easier and quicker to access but may require more careful consideration to ensure its relevance and accuracy.
 - <b>Automated data collection:</b> Using tools such as web scraping, application programming interfaces (APIs), or data integration platforms to automatically gather data from online sources or databases. This method is efficient for collecting large volumes of data and keeping it up-to-date.

<h4>Evaluating data quality:</h4>

Once data is collected, it's essential to evaluate its quality. Consider the following aspects:

 - <b>Accuracy:</b> Ensure that the data accurately reflects the real-world scenarios you are studying.
 - <b>Completeness:</b> Check for missing values or incomplete records that might skew your analysis.
 - <b>Consistency:</b> Ensure that data is consistent across different sources and time periods.
 - <b>Timeliness:</b> Data should be current and relevant to the time frame of your analysis.

<h4>Data integration and storage:</h4>

After collecting data from various sources, the next step is to integrate it into a cohesive data set. This may involve merging data sets, transforming data formats, or cleaning data to ensure uniformity. Once integrated, store the data securely, ensuring that it is organised and easily accessible for analysis.

By mastering these techniques, you'll be well-prepared to gather and utilise data effectively, setting the stage for a successful data analysis project.

<h3>Methods for performing exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and insights:</h3>

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial stage in the data science process. It allows you to understand the underlying configuration of your data and identify key patterns and relationships. EDA involves using statistical techniques and data visualisation to summarise the main characteristics of the data set.

<h4>Descriptive statistics:</h4>

Begin your EDA by calculating descriptive statistics, which provide a summary of the basic features of your data. Key metrics include:

 - <b>Mean, median, and mode:</b> These measures of central tendency help you understand the typical value in your data set.
 - <b>Standard deviation and variance:</b> These metrics indicate the spread or dispersion of your data, showing how much variation exists from the average.
 - <b>Min, max, and range:</b> These values provide insights into the bounds of your data, highlighting any potential outliers.

<h4>Data visualisation:</h4>

Visualisation is a powerful tool in EDA, helping you to quickly grasp complex data distributions and relationships. Common visualisation techniques include:

 - <b>Histograms and density plots:</b> Useful for understanding the distribution of a single variable, including its central tendency and spread.
 - <b>Box plots:</b> Help identify the spread and outliers in your data by showing the quartiles and median.
 - <b>Scatter plots:</b> Ideal for examining relationships between two continuous variables, helping you identify potential correlations or trends.
 - <b>Bar charts and heatmaps:</b> Useful for categorical data, showing the frequency or proportion of categories and the relationships between categorical variables.

<h4>Correlation analysis:</h4>

To uncover relationships between variables, perform a correlation analysis. This involves calculating correlation coefficients, such as Pearson’s or Spearman’s, which quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. Understanding these correlations can help you identify key predictors of customer churn.

<h4>Data profiling and anomaly detection:</h4>

Data profiling involves examining data for anomalies, missing values, or inconsistencies. This phase is essential for ensuring data quality before proceeding to model building. Look for patterns in missing data, which could indicate underlying data collection issues or important missing information.

<h4>Hypothesis generation:</h4>

Based on the insights gained from descriptive statistics and visualisations, formulate hypotheses about your data. For example, you might hypothesise that high customer service interaction frequency is related to increased churn rates. These hypotheses can guide your subsequent analysis and model-building efforts.

Employing these methods can help you uncover critical insights from your data, guiding your understanding and informing your decision-making process as you prepare for more advanced data analysis stages.
