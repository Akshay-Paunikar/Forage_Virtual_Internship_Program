Enhance Customer retention strategies by mastering data analysis and uncovering key insights into customer behaviour

<h3>Task overview:</h3>

Welcome! In this task, you will focus on gathering and analysing data to understand customer behaviour, with the goal of uncovering key insights that will inform the development of a predictive model for customer churn.

<b>What you'll learn:</b>

 - Techniques for identifying and collecting relevant data from various sources
 - Methods for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights
 - Best practices for cleaning and preparing data for machine learning models

<b>What you'll do:</b>

 - Identify and gather data from provided sources relevant to predicting customer churn
 - Perform EDA to understand the data and identify key features

<h3>Let's get started:</h3>

As you step into the role of a data science graduate at Lloyds Banking Group, you're immediately thrust into a real-world scenario with significant implications for our business. The Data Science & Analytics team, under the leadership of Li, a seasoned senior data scientist, is currently grappling with a critical project: predicting customer churn to enhance retention strategies.

Li briefs you on the situation, "We've observed a worrying trend of customers, particularly young professionals and small business owners, leaving for competitors. This project aims to reverse that trend by identifying at-risk customers and implementing targeted interventions."

Your task is crucial. You'll begin by gathering and analysing data to understand the factors contributing to customer churn to uncover actionable insights that can inform strategic decisions. The pressure is on, as SmartBank, a key subsidiary, has reported a decline in retention rates, and there's mounting pressure from senior management to deliver solutions swiftly.

Li emphasises the importance of this task, noting, "Our findings will directly impact the strategies we deploy to retain our customers. We need accurate, insightful analysis to inform these strategies."

You're not alone in this; the team is here to guide and support you. This is your opportunity to apply your skills, contributing to a project that could shape the future of customer engagement at Lloyds.
