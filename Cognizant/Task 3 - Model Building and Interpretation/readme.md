<h3>Task 3 - Model Building and Interpretation</h3>
Building a predictive model and interpreting the results back to the business

<h3>Here is the background information on your task:</h3>
It is now time to get started with some machine learning!

The client has provided 3 datasets, it is now your job to combine, transform and model these datasets in a suitable way to answer the problem statement that the 
business has requested. 

Most importantly, once the modeling process is complete, we need you to communicate your work and analysis in the form of a single PowerPoint slide, so that we 
can present the results back to the business. The key here is to use business-friendly language and to explain your results in a way that the business will 
understand. For example, ensure that when you’re summarizing the performance of the results you don't use technical metrics, but rather convert it into numbers that 
they'll understand.

<h3>Here is your task:</h3>
You have previously outlined the strategic plan for completing the modeling work based on the problem statement.

It is now time for you to deliver on this strategic plan. Some additional resources have been provided to help you with this task. If you feel comfortable enough to 
complete this task on your own, use the “modeling.ipynb” Python notebook to get started. However, if you’re not sure where to start and would like to be guided 
through the modeling process, use the “modeling_walkthrough.ipynb” notebook. 

Feel free to use these notebooks in a similar way that we did before, using Google Colab. If you prefer to use them within your own development environment, that's 
fine too.

The modeling process should take 35-45 minutes.

Once you’re done with the modeling, summarize your results in a business-friendly single PowerPoint slide. Be sure to explain whether this model can help them to 
tackle the problem statement.

<h3>Here are some resources to help you:</h3>
Note: The [modelling.ipynb] and [modelling_walkthrough.ipynb] resources below are a specific type of file that must be opened by a Python interpreter. So this 
task will give you great hands-on experience with Python interpreters! A Python interpreter is a program installed on your computer whose job it is to look at 
and run your Python code. For more information, see this resource by Stanford computer science. To open these files, you should use Google Colab.
