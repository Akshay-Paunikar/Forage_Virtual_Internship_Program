<h3>Task 3: Translating Assumptions to the P&L</h3>

<h4>Here is your task</h4>

Armed with a completed set of forecast assumptions, we now turn our attention to producing a forecast profit and loss (P&L) statement. This financial statement shows 
a company’s profit or loss over a particular period (typically a financial year). 

The profit or loss is calculated by taking total revenue and subtracting expenses that stem from both operating and non-operating activities. It lays out revenue, 
direct costs, gross profit, operating expenses, depreciation, amortization, net interest, taxes and net profit in a logical manner.

Your task is to use the P&L Excel template provided to complete the task. 

You will notice that the P&L’s structure typically follows that of the assumptions sheet in terms of order, with a number of performance metrics included between the 
P&L line items (e.g. revenue growth, margin percentages). The included glossary should also prove useful to navigate any unfamiliar terms.
