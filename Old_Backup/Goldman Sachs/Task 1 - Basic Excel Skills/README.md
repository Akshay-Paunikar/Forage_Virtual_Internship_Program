<h3>Task 1: Basic Excel Skills</h3>

<h4>Here is your task</h4>

Microsoft Excel is the most widely used spreadsheet tool in the banking and finance industry today. Regardless of whether you pursue a career in accounting, 
corporate finance, commercial banking or investment banking, you can expect to use Microsoft Excel on a regular basis.

To maximize your chances of career success, mastering Excel as early as possible is key. As a new graduate at the firm, your first task is to run through a series of 
worked examples, designed to teach the fundamentals of Excel, as they apply to banking and finance applications.

Broadly, these worked examples cover:

 - Cell Basics (alignment, cell manipulation, column and row manipulation, text formats, cell formats, dates, basic formulas, copying, pasting and transposing)
 - Formatting (numbers, borders, column/row alignment, text to column)
 - Comments (adding, removing)
 - Naming (name manager, use in formulas)
 - Setting up a new sheet (header, font selection and font size, column and row sizing)

Your task is to work through each example within the provided Excel file. Note that detailed hints are included alongside each of the examples to assist you.
