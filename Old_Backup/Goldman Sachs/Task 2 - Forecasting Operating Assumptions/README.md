<h3>Task 2: Forecasting Operating Assumptions</h3>

<h4>Here is your task</h4>

Congratulations on completing the first module – before you know it, you’ll be using shortcuts without even realizing it!

Your firm has been asked to assist its client, a cupcake shop that produces baked goods for both consumers and businesses, with forecasting its business plan. 
They are keen to understand what their business will look like in five years’ time if all goes to plan. 

Your task is to create a set of assumptions within the Excel template provided, based on the information from the client contained within the file. 
The operating assumptions are split out between Revenue, Costs, Cash Flow and Other.

Your task is to complete the provided Excel template to build out forecast assumptions, which hones the skills you learned in Module 1. 

You have also been provided with a glossary of key terms within the Excel file.
