Welcome to the Data Science Virtual Experience Programme! We are so excited to have you here!

Here at Standard Bank, we’re passionate about driving sustainable, inclusive growth across Africa. The kind of growth that will make a positive and 
lasting impact on all our lives. And we put Africa’s dreams, our clients’ dreams, and our peoples’ dreams at the heart of everything we do. 

During this programme, you will get the opportunity to step into the shoes of a Standard Bank team member and complete tasks that replicate the work 
that our Data Science team does every day. You’ll learn how to understand the data science project lifecycle, course train a model, and present the 
process as it relates to business objectives.

We hope this programme provides a great resource for you to up-skill and strengthen your resume as you explore career options and a potential career at Standard Bank!
