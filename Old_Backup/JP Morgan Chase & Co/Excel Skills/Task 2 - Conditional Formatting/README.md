<h3>Task 2: Conditional Formatting</h3>

<h4>About data cleaning</h4>
When working with data in Excel, one of the first things you should do is understand the data you have. What kind of data is it? How is it structured? Is it good 
quality data, or does it need cleaning up? This is often called “exploring” your data. You want to understand the characteristics of your data and also its 
limitations. 

Exploring the data lets you look for trends or patterns as well as operationally or financially significant values, like negative or positive sales growth, an 
underwater stock option value, a negative inventory level, or any items sold prior to a certain date. Becoming aware of such characteristics of the data would then 
let you ask questions about the source and quality of the data. Does a negative inventory level signify a database that reflects order quantity greater than 
fulfilled quantity as a negative inventory level? Or does the dataset or its source have errors in it?    

When exploring your data, some of the things you can look for include:

 - Missing values
 - Repeated / duplicate values
 - Errors in the data or in calculations that drive values in the data
 - Trends and patterns
 - Values that are negative or positive
 - Values that are larger or smaller than a cutoff value
 - Values that occur in a certain date range

Conditional formatting is a technique in Excel to make data exploration visual. You format the data (its colors, fonts, highlighting, etc.) based on the criteria 
you select. This allows you to quickly identify values that are either a data quality problem (missing values, formula errors, nonsensical values, etc.) or a value 
that drives insights and decisions (i.e., sales growth below a set target; inventory below a set amount, which would trigger re-ordering; etc.)

Excel’s conditional formatting tools are easy to use but have a large and powerful array of options for criteria to base formatting on, including the ability to 
write your own formulas. You can even use the conditional formatting tools to format colorful and visually easy-to-read reports and simple dashboards of your data, 
creating visuals such as “heat maps” and even “Harvey ball” rankings to visually indicate data that meet specific criteria.  

If you are experienced with Excel’s conditional formatting capabilities, then the task below will be very straightforward. But if you have not spent much time 
immersed in conditional formatting, now is the time to learn these techniques. 

On the next step you'll see some videos about conditional formatting. In less than an hour, you will learn all you need to know about this powerful data exploration 
tool.

<h4>Here is your task</h4>
Your task is to use Excel’s conditional formatting tools to explore and visualize the characteristics of the data in the dataset provided in the Additional 
Resources section below.  

First, familiarize yourself with Excel’s conditional formatting tools by watching the introductory videos using the links provided in Additional Resources. 
If you are already comfortable with how to use conditional formatting, feel free to refresh your memory with the videos or move on to the exercise.  

Then, open the spreadsheet and familiarize yourself with the data. What kind of data is there? What information do the columns contain? What kind of trends 
could you see with this kind of data?  

Then, use the conditional formatting tools (either the menu-based tools or write your own conditional formatting formulas, whichever you prefer) to do the 
following explorations of the data:

 - Highlight any cells with formula errors in purple with white text.
 - Highlight any cells with missing values in yellow.
 - Identify accounts that have not been cross-sold with Product 2 by highlighting the appropriate Product 2 cells in orange.
 - Identify accounts that have a 5-year sales CAGR of at least 100% by highlighting the appropriate CAGR cells in green and any accounts with a negative CAGR in red with white text.
 - Identify accounts in the top 10% of unit sales for 2021 by highlighting the appropriate 2021 unit sales cells in blue.

Once you have your conditional formatting working correctly, take a screenshot of your colorfully coded spreadsheet and submit it as a PDF file.
