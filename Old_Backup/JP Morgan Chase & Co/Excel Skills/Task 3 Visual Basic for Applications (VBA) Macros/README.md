<h3>Task 3 Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Macros</h3>

<h4>About Visual Basic for Applications (VBA):</h4>

Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a useful language to learn and skill to develop because it is built into the entire suite of Microsoft products, meaning VBA 
is also the programming language built into Word, PowerPoint, and other Microsoft applications. This means you can use VBA to integrate data and reporting across 
the entire Microsoft suite.

Like any programming language, VBA has its own vocabulary, syntax, and commands to learn. With VBA, you can write sophisticated programs that exceed tasks you could 
do manually on the keyboard and mouse. While becoming skilled at writing complex VBA programs takes many hours of training, you can learn in just a few minutes to 
create simple macros to automate common, repetitive tasks in Excel.

A macro is simply a short list of commands written in VBA to automate a set of tasks you could otherwise do manually using the keyboard and mouse. Excel has two 
methods built-in for creating macros. The easiest way is to “record” the macro, which means telling Excel to “watch” your actions as you do a task using the keyboard 
and mouse and automatically create a list of commands in VBA that correspond to those actions. Then, you can tell Excel to automatically run that list of commands 
over and over as needed. That list or script of commands is your macro, and you can assign it to a button on the screen to run it at will. The other method for 
creating macros is to write the list of commands (the VBA code) yourself without having Excel watch your actions and generate that list for you.

On the next step you'll see some videos on how to record macros and write macro scripts. In less than 30 minutes, you will be creating your own simple macros!

<h4>Here is your task</h4>

Your task is to familiarize yourself with recording and using simple macros in Excel, and then create two macros using the same spreadsheet you modified with 
conditional formatting from Task 1. A clean version of that spreadsheet is available in Additional Resources below so you can work from a fresh copy.  

If you have worked with Excel macros before, this task should be relatively easy; if not, now is the time to dig into macros and learn the basics. First, spend some 
time watching training videos to become familiar with the basics of macros and how to record a simple macro. Start with the links in Additional Resources below for 
a few short training videos, but feel free to find more online. 

In most versions of Excel, you have to enable the “developer” tab in the menu to work with macros and VBA. If your copy of Excel does not have this tab visible, 
you can right-click on the ribbon and add the tab to the menu. If you are using the online version of Excel, a similar capability exists under the “Automate” tab, 
where VBA code is called “scripts” and recording macros is called “record actions.” It’s the same general functionality in the online version of Excel as in the 
desktop version, just re-titled in the menus of the online version.  

Then, follow the basic steps outlined in the “Beginners Guide to Macros” video in Additional Resources to create two macros and associate them with buttons you 
add to your spreadsheet.  

You will create two macros and associated buttons:

 - A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 5 YR CAGR in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall 5-year sales growth
 - A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 2021 unit sales in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall unit sales in 2021

When you are finished, you will have two buttons that let you very quickly and easily see two ways of analyzing account sales data to inform account planning and 
other operational decision-making and quickly switch between them.  

Submit a PDF file with a screenshot of your spreadsheet showing your buttons and a screenshot of the VBA code from one of your macros.
