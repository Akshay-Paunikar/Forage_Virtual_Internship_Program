    " - The key topics within the reviews include “service”, “seat”, “crew” and “staff”, showing that people are actively talking about their experience and staff.\n",
    " - Out of 1000 reviews, 546 were positive - 55%, 437 were negative - 43% and 17 were neutral - 2%. This means the majority of reviews were polarised as either positive or negative.\n",
    " - The most important variable in the model was purchase_lead, that is the time between purchase and departure.\n",
    " - Information about the flight, e.g. flight time and duration was also significant, however booking origin of the customer was not important\n",
    " - The accuracy of the model was approximately 0.7 (Precision) and 0.003 (Recall), showing that this model requires more improvement. I suggest adding more customer-centric features into the model."
