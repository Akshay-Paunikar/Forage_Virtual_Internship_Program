<h2>Task 2 - Responsible AI</h2>
Understanding how AI leads to better decisions.

<h3>Task Overview</h3>
<b></b>What you'll learn</b>
 - The significance of Responsible AI in decision-making.
 - How to build a Python classification model.
 - Analyzing feature importance in a classification model.

<b>What you'll do</b>
 - Build a Python classification model.
 - Analyze which features affect the model's decisions the most, both overall and for specific cases.
 - Create visual representations and provide comments on your findings.

<h3>Here is your task</h3>
Ready? Download Jupyer Notebook and start creating. For your additional analysis and comments, you could use a PowerPoint slide deck and as well or do everything in the tool.
 - Create a classification model in Python. Feel free to use libraries such as SkLearn, Keras/Tensorflow or Pytorch.
 - Analyse the model and provide insight into which features/variables influence the outcome of the classification the most: on a global level, and specifically for observation #4 and #20.
 - Develop some form of plot or graph with brief comments on your observations.

Heads up! Jakob left you a voice message to help you with this task.
 
“Hi there,

Thanks for helping with the task. And don’t worry too much about the performance of the model. What’s important is that you create a classification model and that you try to evaluate the relevance of potential features, both on a global and a local level.

Getting familiar with the Lime and SHAP libraries will help.

Thanks and catch you later.”

This experience is self-paced. However, Jakob is meeting the management in 1.5 hours and needs your great model and analysis. We recommend you spend no more than that completing this task.
