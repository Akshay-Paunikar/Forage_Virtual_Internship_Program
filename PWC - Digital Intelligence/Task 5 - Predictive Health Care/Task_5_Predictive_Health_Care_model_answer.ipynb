    "<b>Step 1</b>\n",

    "Create a descriptive overview of adverse effects of tramal based on the available FAERS datasets, which youâ€™ll find in your resource section. For your analysis, only use the FAERS data from the year 2019.\n",

    "Show the 10 most common adverse effects as they are reported in the FAERS database. Jakob loves bar plots, so would be great if you use one.\n",

    "Compare tramal to another medication called lyrica that is also commonly used to treat neurological pain. Are the adverse effects similar?\n",
