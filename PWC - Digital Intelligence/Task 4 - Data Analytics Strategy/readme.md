<h3>Here is the background information on your task:</h3>
There’s no longer any doubt. We live in the age of exponential data growth. And using data in decision-making is a must-have to remain competitive.

Data assets can generate value by improving decision-making and operations including production, distribution, sales and marketing. An effective data strategy can also put data to work for the business on fraud detection and automatic content generation with AI, for example. Specific needs should be derived from the business strategy.

At PwC we develop a data strategy by creating a data vision, defining data reports and analysing data platform maturity. We develop a group-wide data strategy and enable clients to add value by helping them efficiently analyse their own data, produce reports and create dashboards.

We’re off to Bern now, to work with a Digital Intelligence team helping a client define their data strategy. The company produces a lot of data, but it is stored in many different places. Management wants to maximise the value of their data assets. Their goal is to build an infrastructure that supports the intelligent use of data within the company.

<h3>Here is your task:</h3>
