<h2>Task 6 - Predictive and Statistical Modelling</h2>
Predicting damage risks at waste management sites

<h3>Task Overview:</h3>

<b>What you'll learn</b>

 - Predictive modeling for insurance reserves.
 - How to calculate aggregate claims and expected costs.
 - How to find Value at Risk (VaR) for reserves.

<b>What you'll do</b>

 - Create a presentation about reserves and data analysis.
 - Review assumptions, fit distributions, and calculate losses.
 - Determine VaR and consider modeling enhancements.

<h3>Here is the background information on your task:</h3>

You and Jakob hit the road again. Your last stop is Lucerne, where our client, a mutual insurance association, is domiciled. They offer insurance coverage for a wide range of insurance risks relating to waste incinerator stations and other companies in the waste management industry. Two types of sites are covered:

 - Waste incinerator stations (WIS)
 - Landfill sites (non-WIS)

The company insures four WIS sites and two 2 non-WIS or “dump” sites in Switzerland. The insurance provides coverage for the following perils:

 - Property damage for conventional installations
 - Fire
 - Machinery breakdown  

At WIS sites, the majority of the property is conventional, making these property damage risks comparable to those in other industrial sites and include e.g. turbines. Fire but also small risks such as surveillance cameras are covered. Most of the claims are a result of these small types of risks. However, medium and large losses – up to a few 100 million CHF due to large fire – are possible.

<b>Here’s where predictive modelling comes in:</b>

The insurer needs to set up equalisation reserves for annual aggregate claim amounts that may occur in the future. All historically reported claims until the end of 2020 were immediately settled in full or paid out to the insured; no case or IBNR reserves were needed. The purpose of the equalisation reserves is to provide a cushion for fluctuation in the claims experience over the next year.

As a part of the actuarial services team, your job is to derive the aggregate claims distribution over a 1-year time horizon. Based on this distribution, derive the expected annual aggregate claim costs as well as the 80% VaR (Value at Risk). The value of 80% is not untypical for a Swiss insurance company setting up equalisation reserves.

You will need to know several assumptions around claims modelling and distribution, as well as parameters of the claim distribution. Learn about these in the resources provided.

<h3>Here is your task:</h3>

<b>As part of the Actuarial Services team, you and Jakob prepare a PowerPoint slide deck or a Word document to tackle the task. If needed, provide the R script in your slide deck to explain your assumptions.</b>
