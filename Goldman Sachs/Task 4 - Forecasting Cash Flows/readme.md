<h3>Task 4 - Forecasting Cash Flows</h3>
Understand how the P&L translates to Cash Flow Forecasting

<h4>Here is the background information on your task</h4>
To ensure that the cupcake shop has enough cash to execute its 5-year plan, we need to forecast the cupcake shopâ€™s future cash flows. This will involve calculating 
the net cash flow for each year for the business, taking into account key operating, investing and financing cash flows. 

It is noteworthy that the client has indicated that any excess net cash flow is to be used to pay down debt (as opposed to adding to the cash balance).

<h4>Here is your task</h4>
Your senior has provided you with a simplified template for forecasting future cash flows. 

Your task is to utilize the cash flow assumptions alongside the previously completed P&L tab to complete the Cash Flow tab. This will ultimately show whether the 
cupcake shop will have enough cash during the forecast period to continue to pay down its debt and maintain a positive cash balance. 

The final part of the task is then to link up the Net Interest line in the P&L with the calculated figures within the Cash Flow tab.
