<h3>Task 3 - Propose Data Analysis Approaches</h3>
Explore data insights that can be unlocked with social media

<h3>Here is the background information on your task:</h3>
There are many different types of data, such as images, tabular data, documents, Excel files, etc. However, data types broadly fall into two categories, structured 
data and unstructured data.

In the previous two tasks, you dealt with structured data. Structured data has a consistent structure (i.e., coming from a database with a consistent schema). 
For this task, you will be exploring the value we can unlock from unstructured data in the form of written tweets.

First, you’ll want to look at the type of data that you can scrape from the Twitter account by exploring the Twitter API. Then, you’ll propose some ways in which 
InsightSpark could extract insights from this data to enrich its database.

<h3>Here is your task:</h3>
Start by familiarising yourself with the “@CommBank Twitter Account” to see what information is publicly available.

When you’re comfortable with the Twitter interface, move forward and begin to look into the Twitter API. “Twitter API: Data Dictionary” will show you the types of 
information that you can scrape from Twitter automatically using a programming language like Python. “Twitter: Build for Business,” on the other hand, will provide 
you with insights into how this information can be used in a business environment.

Once you’ve familiarised yourself with the referenced resources, write a proposal that suggests ways that InsightSpark can use the available data on the @CommBank 
Twitter account to extract valuable insights. Then, submit your proposal in the text field below.
