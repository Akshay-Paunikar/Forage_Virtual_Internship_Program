<h3>Task 2 - Data Anonymisation</h3>
Anonymise personal data within a data set

<h3>Here is the background information on your task:</h3>
For CBA and InsightSpark to continue with the data science vision, the data scientists at InsightSpark need to combine customer data with the transactional data from the supermarkets.

The customer data will come from the CBA mobile app. However, we cannot provide them with the raw data until it has been suitably anonymised to protect the identity of individuals in the data set.

It is your job to design a privacy pipeline to execute on the data set. This pipeline must anonynmise the data set while preserving useful information.

Data privacy is crucial in preventing linkage attacks. This attack is a way of recovering personal information about people from an anonymised data set. Itâ€™s a powerful technique that can be executed with even the smallest personal information. Review the following resource for more information about linkage attacks.
