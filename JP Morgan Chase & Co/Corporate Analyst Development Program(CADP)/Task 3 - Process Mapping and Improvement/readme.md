<h3>Task 3 - Process Mapping and Improvement</h3>
<h4>Document a business process and identify and communicate opportunities for improvement.</h4>

<h3>Here is the background information on your task:</h3>
There are several key benefits to visually mapping out process flows:
1. Helping your team brainstorm ideas for improvement
2. Bringing stakeholders together and gaining their buy-in and support
3. Ensuring all steps are captured and all costs are identified
4. Identifying drivers of wasted time and effort including rework
5. Identifying risks

How do you create and analyze a process map?  Follow these basic steps:
1. Identify a process you want to map.
2. List the steps in the process and put them in the right order. Some may occur sequentially, some may occur in parallel, and some may depend on a decision point.
3. Consider questions such as:
 - Who initiates the process? How is it initiated?
 - Who does each work step? What tools, materials, or information do they need at that step?
 - At which points in the process are decisions made?
 - Who reviews for quality? How do they do that?
 - Who decides the work is complete or acceptable? How do they do that?
4. Include any step that requires time or a decision even if it doesnâ€™t include value added work.
5. Then consider opportunities for improvement:
 - Steps where work is paused, redone, or manually accomplished
 - Steps that can be automated, or eliminated
 - Steps that can be done in parallel
 - Steps that can be done in a different way to reduce time and cost or increase revenue
6. Also, consider benchmarks.
 - Who is doing this better and how do they do it?
 - What market or customer KPIs can you measurably improve?
 - How do changes in those KPIs translate into cost reduction or revenue improvement?

Simple process maps often show just one type of flow, and more complex process maps can show different flows in relation to each other (sometimes called a swim lane 
diagram). There are many process mapping tools available which make it easy to draw process maps using the UML (Unified Modeling Language) standards for process map 
symbols (i.e. a diamond for a decision point, a rectangle for a process step, etc.). In this task, you will use the UML symbols available in PowerPoint to draft your 
process map.

<h3>Here is your task:</h3>
Your task is to draw a one-page process map for a simple version of a mortgage loan underwriting and origination process. Afterwards, consider opportunities for 
improving the process to enhance shareholder value and client experience using the analysis process. Perhaps a step could be done faster, automated, eliminated, 
or accomplished a different way with a new tool or a new JPMorgan Chase & Co. product or service offering. Think broadly and creatively. What opportunities for 
improvement do you see?

The steps in the process you will map are outlined in the Simple Mortgage Origination Process steps document found in the Additional Resources. You will also find 
the Process Mapping Template document you will use to draw the process and document your suggestions. Feel free to do your own research online about mortgage 
underwriting and originating to learn more or find inspiration for ways to improve the process.

To help you get a feel for how a simple process map works and what it might look like, see the Example Process Map Document in the Additional Resources to see a 
process mapped out for baking a cake!
