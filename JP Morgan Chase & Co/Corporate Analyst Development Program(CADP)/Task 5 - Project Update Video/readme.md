<h3>Task 5 - Project Update Video</h3>
<h4>Write and record a video update message to project stakeholders.</h4>

<h3>Here is the background information on your task:</h3>
We increasingly communicate via video than we do in an audio format so the ability to communicate clearly with a compelling message via video is important. Remember, 
the three Cs still apply to verbal communication as much as written communication when telling your story. Be clear, concise, and compelling. 

When speaking, it is a greater challenge to hold the listener’s attention and make it easy for them to follow. Organize your thoughts ahead of time to ensure there 
is a logical order and a strong conclusion. 

More importantly, you must first decide on your target audience before you write and deliver your communication. 

Again, it is important to remember to be clear, concise, and compelling. Brevity is almost always the best course of action.

<h3>Here is your task:</h3>
Your task is to write, record, and submit a short video message, acting as a team leader, to update your project stakeholders about your project. 

Write your talking points or script loosely based on the following information about your project:
 - You are in week 6 of a 24-week project
 - Your first major stakeholders' meeting is coming up in a week, and you want to make sure all the stakeholders attend
 - The first big milestone was met on schedule
 - The second big milestone is currently well behind schedule, due to an unforeseen resource need that was not planned for and has not yet been met
 - You need the stakeholders to make a decision at the upcoming meeting to provide the resource needed or the project will fall further behind schedule
 - You have some ideas for making up some of the schedule delays that you will discuss at the upcoming meeting

Use your imagination to fill in any details or additional points, using the above as a loose framework. Make up additional details to use in your message as you feel 
appropriate to tell a good story for your project update. 

Keep your video short, there is no need to record more than a few minutes. Let your winning personality, enthusiasm, and organized storytelling shine through!

For this exercise, don’t worry about camera quality, lighting, background, or other video production elements. Just use what you have available – using your mobile 
phone to record your video is just fine for this exercise. Your clearly delivered message is the important thing.  And if you want some tips and best practices for
