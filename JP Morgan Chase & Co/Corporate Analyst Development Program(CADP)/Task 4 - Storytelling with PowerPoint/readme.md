<h3>Task 4 - Storytelling with PowerPoint</h3>
<h4>Write a short PowerPoint presentation to communicate key ideas and talking points and tell a compelling story.</h4>

<h3>Here is the background information on your task:</h3>
The first step in communicating a great story is understanding to whom you are communicating. Who is your audience? In the context of business communications, usually 
your audience is one or more stakeholders for your task, project, or activity. 

Understanding your stakeholders and gaining their insights and buy-in effectively is critical to the success of any business activity. You will have many interactions 
with your stakeholders, from informal brainstorming sessions to formal project update communications. 

Your first step is to understand your set of stakeholders. Who are they? What is their interest in the project?  How can they contribute? Which are most important to 
the success of your project? What decisions do you need them to make? 

Once you understand their needs, motivations, the decisions you want them to make, and the actions you want them to take, then you can map out the compelling story 
you are going to tell them.

See the links in Additional Resources below, for some further reading about storytelling in business communications.

<h3>Here is your task:</h3>
Your task is to write a short PowerPoint presentation to communicate key ideas and talking points about one of the opportunities for process improvement that you 
identified in the prior task. You can pick any opportunity for process improvement that you like. Perhaps your story will be about a new technology that can help 
accomplish a specific task? Or, perhaps it will be about a new way to automate something currently done manually? You pick the story you want to tell.

Your first step is to pick a stakeholder group that you will target your communication toward. Great presentations are clear, concise, and compelling. To be clear, 
concise, and compelling, they need to communicate key ideas of interest to a specific target audience. To which stakeholder group will you write your presentation? 
Choose from these possible stakeholders:
 - Internal Teams (upstream or downstream)
 - Senior leaders
 - JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s clients

Pick the audience you will speak to in your presentation. Then, review your background research on the opportunity for process improvement you chose from the prior 
task, or do additional background research if needed. What data, ideas, or examples would be compelling to your chosen stakeholder group about your process 
improvement concept?

Then, write your presentation using the template found in Additional Resources below.  Feel free to add slides to the template if you need to, but remember: clear, 
concise, and compelling. Shorter is almost always better. In no more than 3-5 slides:
 - Write a compelling title to grab the attention of your audience.
 - Convey a key overarching point using a compelling visual you find online to further grab your reader’s attention. Just copy and paste a photo that you find 
online; no need for original artwork.
 - Define the process targeted, the problem, and the big idea you are proposing.
 - Communicate key points about your concept, the process you are improving, why and how it should be improved, and the benefits to be gained.

Use data and examples to make your presentation compelling when appropriate.
