<h3>Task 1 - Data Analysis and Simple Visualization in Excel</h3>
<h4>Demonstrate some basic data analysis and visualization techniques in Excel.</h4>

<h3>Here is the background information on your task:</h3>
At JPMorgan Chase & Co., analytics is an important skill used in many roles. Data analytics, specifically, is the ability to gain meaningful insights from data 
and communicate them in a clear and concise way. The analytics rotation in CADP is designed to challenge you to design and interpret data using different tools 
including Microsoft Excel for analyzing financial or operational data.  

In Excel, you can accomplish an analysis in many ways through basic, intermediate, and advanced techniques. The basic techniques are typically more manual, 
while the advanced techniques may allow for automation and more complex analysis. Having knowledge of different techniques will be useful as you use Excel.

There are literally hundreds of functions, tools, and techniques built into Excel, but some of the most common Excel analysis tools you should know include:
Basic:
 - Calculation Formulas: Sum, Count, Average
 - Conditional Formulas:  IF, SUMIF, COUNTIF
 - Sorting: Order columns by one or more criteria

Intermediate:
 - Filters: Select and only see rows that meet one or more conditions.
 - Formulas: VLOOKUP
 - Charts: Plot data using various chart types

Advanced:
 - Pivot tables: automatically group matching data to generate summary tables
 - Pivot charts: automatically generated plots of data in a pivot table

Use the links below in the Additional Resources section to find quick online tutorials about these key Excel tools. In less than an hour, you will learn the 
basic concepts and how to implement them in Excel.

You will usually find that an analysis can be done in more than one way. For example, when working with the home mortgage dataset in your task below, how could you 
chart the answer to the question, “How many mortgage customers are in each borrower age range?” You have at least three options:
 - Manually filter the data, manually count the number of rows for each filtered borrower age range, then chart those numbers using a new table of those values
 - Use COUNTIF or SUMIF functions to calculate the number of mortgages that meet each borrower's age range criteria, then chart the numbers in that resulting table
 - Use a pivot table and pivot chart to automatically group the summary data and plot the chart
Which you choose will depend on how quickly you need the answer, how big your data set is, how often you need to generate an updated answer, and how adept you are at 
quickly using the advanced tools in Excel.

<h3>Here is your task:</h3>
One of the many activities that you could encounter as a CADP analyst is the analysis of sales or utilization of financial products and identification of 
opportunities for upselling or the cross-selling of other products. For this task, you will analyze a set of data about home mortgages, one of the many 
financial products analysts work on every day, and help identify good targets for further sales activities.

Your task is to analyze the home mortgage data contained in the Excel spreadsheet in Additional Resources below and then create a short PowerPoint presentation 
to communicate your observations and key findings about that data. Utilize appropriate simple visualizations of the data, using the template found in Additional 
Resources. 

First, open the spreadsheet and familiarize yourself with the data. It is a subset of data pulled from a much larger dataset. What kind of data is there? What 
information do the columns contain? What kind of trends could you see if you graphed that data in various ways?   

Then consider: what kinds of observations are relevant to understanding potential sales opportunities? You could consider borrowers as qualified sales leads who, 
for example:
 - Have loan-to-value ratios below 80 (so they have significant equity in their homes)
 - Have homes in locations with a high minority population (which would enable JPMorgan Chase & Co. to increase support to those communities, which is both a 
regulatory and a strategic requirement)
 - Have annual incomes over a certain threshold (so they are more likely to be able to afford more financial products and services)
 - Have homes worth an amount over a certain threshold (so they are more likely to want to invest in them further or borrow against them)

But you don’t need to limit yourself to those. You could analyze the dataset on other variables, for example: age category or median family income in their 
local area. Would those variables point to a well-qualified sales lead? Why, or why not?

Also, how could you analyze the data to see if the extract is likely representative of the larger dataset it was pulled from? Hint: are the appraised home values 
normally distributed? How about annual incomes?

Then, begin your formal analysis of the data. For this task you are going to identify and sum up the number of borrowers who meet the sales qualification 
criteria you choose, to compare which sales qualification criteria or combination of criteria generate the most leads, the least risk and the highest potential leads.  

You may use any of the Excel analysis techniques discussed in the Background Information section above. You may need to filter, sort, or modify the spreadsheet 
so that you can see data subsets for different criteria. You may want to use one or more pivot tables. You may need to use formulas to compute new variables 
to pivot on, such as defined buckets or ranges for some data. The choice of analytical techniques is yours.

Which qualification criteria identify more sales leads? Which identify less but higher quality leads? Decide what insights and findings you think make sense to 
graph or pull out from the data. For example, your analysis and charts could include:
 - Number of borrowers with loan-to-value ratios in ranges
 - Number of borrowers with % minority homeowners in their area in ranges
 - Number of borrowers in annual income ranges
 - Number of borrowers in appraised home value ranges
 - And various combinations thereof

You may consider other ways to analyze the data as you think make sense as well.  

As you chart the data, look for trends, outliers, patterns, and potential opportunities. What do your charts tell you about potential sales opportunities?

Once you have analyzed the data, use the PowerPoint presentation template to communicate your findings by adding in your chosen charts from Excel. On the final 
slide, write your key observations about the data summary. Feel free to modify the template and add or remove slides as needed to fit your chosen data analysis. 
Remember, your job is to make the data easily understandable with observations communicated directly and concisely. Be sure to title your charts with specific 
descriptions of the data in the chart and title the slides with a summary of the chart. Use no more than 5-7 slides to present your data analysis.
