<h3>Task 5: Data-Driven Storytelling</h3>
<h4>Story telling using data:</h4>
Consider the following two statements that communicate data:

  1. Eastern Region sales dropped 4% year over year.
  2. Our Sales Rewards trip to the Bahamas this summer is in danger of being canceled because our team has underperformed our Eastern Region sales growth target by 
  9% this year!

Which statement is more compelling? Which statement motivates the reader to want to take action? Data is good, but a narrative or story told with the data is always 
better.  

Telling a data-driven narrative allows you to directly link the issue you want to address, the insights useful to address the issue, and the action or decision 
you want the reader or listener to take. This linkage depends on the listener’s emotional connection to the story.  The data alone does not convey an emotional 
connection; the narrative does that.

Telling a story with your data makes it easier to build trust, convey meaningful insight, and drive audience engagement.  

Follow certain best practices when telling a data-driven story:

 - Understand your audience. Who are you communicating with? What are their motivations and needs? What will they find compelling?
 - Focus on a few major points. Keep your messaging clear and concise, so it’s memorable.
 - Set the context for your story. Why do your insights matter? Why should the audience care?  
 - Actually write a story. Stories include what is commonly called a story arc: a setup, a tension or issue, a resolution, and/or a call to action. 
 - Use visuals where possible. Tables of numbers are hard to make compelling.
 - Support your credibility as the storyteller. Be honest about data quality issues, missing insights that are needed, and related risks to the action or decision you 
are seeking.

<h4>Here is your task:</h4>

Your task is to write a short PowerPoint presentation to communicate key insights and data from your analysis and visualization work in the prior task. From that work, you have insights into which accounts are and are not performing well, how sales are growing year over year, which account types are selling more units than others, and other kinds of findings that you could communicate. Use your analytical insights and even your Excel dashboard if you like as part of the written story you tell in PowerPoint.

First, do your background learning on data-driven storytelling using the links in Additional Resources below. Then, review your analysis and dashboard from Task 4. What data, ideas, insights, or examples would be compelling to decision-makers about account sales? Don’t limit yourself to just the charts you included in your dashboard. Do other analyses of the dataset if needed to help you tell a compelling story.

Then, write your presentation using the template found in Additional Resources below.  Feel free to add slides to the template if needed, but remember: clear, concise, and compelling. Shorter is almost always better. In no more than 3-5 slides,

  1. Write a compelling title to grab the attention of your audience.
  2. Convey a key, overarching point using a compelling visual you find online to further grab your reader’s attention. Just copy and paste a photo that you find online; no need for original artwork.
  3. Communicate key points and ideas about your account sales analysis, including sales performance (or lack thereof), opportunities for improvement or operational focus, and any other points you think tell a good data-driven story.
  4. Make a recommendation for an action that your audience should take as a result of your analysis of account sales.
Use data and examples to make your presentation compelling when appropriate.
