<h3>Task 4: Data Visualization in Excel</h3>

<h4>About Charts and Dashboards</h4>

To make data-driven business decisions, the decision-makers need an easy way to understand and draw conclusions about insights from your data and analysis. 
Insights can be financial, operational, or related to any other management need. One of the easiest ways to make such insights quickly understandable is by using 
charts or graphs of the data and your analysis of it.  

Business decisions that need the same insights routinely benefit from an interactive or dynamic combination of charts called a dashboard. Dashboards allow you to see 
different views or “slices” of the data, see how different insights relate to each other and gain a complete picture of what the data is saying. This is particularly 
helpful when making operational decisions like which products to market more or differently, which accounts need more sales activity to drive more sales, or which 
products need better inventory management to keep in stock. A dashboard is simply a collection of related charts on one page to make visualizing the data easier.

If you are experienced with Excel’s charting capabilities, then the task below will be straightforward. But if you have not spent much time building charts in Excel, 
or combining various charts into an interactive dashboard, now is the time to learn these techniques. 

On the next step, you'll see some videos about creating charts and dashboards in Excel. In less than an hour, you will learn all about this essential toolset in Excel.

<h4>Here is your task</h4>

Your task is to create a simple dashboard using the account sales dataset you worked with in prior tasks. A clean copy of that spreadsheet is available in Additional 
Resources below.

First, do your background learning using the links in Additional Resources below, particularly for the videos on the basics of building a dashboard in Excel.

Then, consider your dataset. What charts and graphs would be useful related to this data? Unit sales by year? Top 10 accounts by unit sales or CAGR? Effectiveness of 
different marketing programs by the number of sales driven? Sales by account type? There are a variety of different ways you could gain insight from this dataset. 
Pick the ones you find most compelling, and use those to create your dashboard.  

Next, consider how you may need to transform the data in the dataset to simplify your analyses. Raw data is as you find it and often not in the ideal form for 
analysis. You may need to alter the spreadsheet structure or add calculations to support your analysis. Hint: disaggregating the raw data by building a new sheet 
that has a row per sales year per account, rather than a row per account that combines sales data for all five years, will make it much easier to use pivot tables 
for some types of analysis. Could you use one or more macros to make constructing that new sheet easier? You may want to filter the data into different views. 
You will want to add pivot tables to support some kinds of charts you could create. Feel free to change the dataset in any way that supports your analysis.  

Make your data an Excel table (rather than a range). Remember the shortcut for that? It is Ctrl-T. Some of Excel’s more useful capabilities work with data designated 
as a Table in Excel, including dynamic updating of charts and graphs and much of the pivot table functionality. It is a best practice to use Excel Tables when doing 
data analysis.

Be creative! Your dashboard will almost certainly look different than the Model Answer below. You will likely have chosen different ways to look at the data and 
combine those charts into your dashboard. The important part of this exercise is to begin thinking in the mindset of using dashboards to tell the story of your data 
and support the data-driven business decisions that relate to the data.

Once you have your dashboard working correctly, take a screenshot of it and submit it as a PDF file.
