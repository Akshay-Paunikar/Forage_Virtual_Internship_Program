Data Science Virtual Internships

### Our Story
Forage was born in 2017 with a dream to help students from less advantaged backgrounds a chance to discover and land jobs they never thought possible. This dream came from the co-founders' own experiences. With Tom growing up in the country and Pasha growing up in a single-parent household, they learned that there were a lot of barriers to break in terms of access to opportunity as they went through their careers.

In 2017, Forage started as a mentoring startup that helped students from all backgrounds discover careers and land jobs.

In the process of mentoring students, the team found that a better way to solve inequalities in hiring and give underrepresented students a chance to land careers, was by giving them a taste of what work was actually like.

So that’s when Forage invented virtual work experiences. Four years later, we’ve helped over 1.7 million students, worked with over 100 companies, and helped students become up to 5 times more employable–100% free, student-first, and open to anyone wanting to learn.

### Student First
At Forage, we put the student first. Our virtual work experiences are built to give students a chance to really learn what it’s like to work at a company. We work with our companies to give students the learning and advantages to get them ahead in their careers.

Our business model, our product, and our team are geared towards creating the most opportunity possible for as many students as possible.

On top of this, everyone in our team joins Forage with a genuine connection and passion for our mission and our learners. We've had people who have started nonprofits to help students join us, product managers who have mentored the next generation join us, and even ex-recruiters from top companies too. The reason they joined was to make the world better for those learners who want to make it in the world.

We put the student first, because we want to and we believe that by doing so we can be the change in the world we want to see.
